 ## Running the Simulation

### Launching the Simulation

- The Python script `lane_change.py` starts the SUMO GUI and initializes the simulation.
- Vehicles are placed on a two-lane road as defined in the `Basic_Test.rou.xml`.
### Real-Time Interaction

The script uses the [TraCI API](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/TraCI.html) to:
- Retrieve real-time data from SUMO.
- Apply the lane change scheduling algorithm.
- Send updated commands (e.g., speed adjustments, lane changes) back to SUMO.

### Generating Outputs

- Logs lane change events, reasons, and total scheduling time in the terminal.
- Plots for scheduling time and vehicle positions are saved in the `outputs/` directory.

## Explanation of Code Files

#### Varoiuos Components of the project and Dataflow

### `Basic_Test.net.xml`

Defines the road network:
- Two lanes (`E0_0` and `E0_1`) with lengths of 100 meters.
- Junctions (`J0` and `J1`) at the start and end of the road segment.
- Configures lane properties, including speed limits and lane geometries.

### `Basic_Test.rou.xml`

Configures the vehicles in the simulation:
- Defines six vehicles (`v_0` to `v_5`).
- Vehicle properties include:
  - Acceleration: 2.5 m/s²
  - Deceleration: 2.5 m/s²
  - Minimum gap: 10 meters.
- Specifies routes for all vehicles along the road (`E0`).

### `Basic_Test.sumocfg`

Combines the network and route files:
- Loads `Basic_Test.net.xml` and `Basic_Test.rou.xml`.
- Sets the simulation time to 100 seconds.

### `lane_change.py`

Implements the lane change scheduling algorithm using the following core functions:
- **fFW (Forward Trajectory Computation)**: Predicts future positions and velocities of vehicles.
- **fMP (Minimum Predecessor Calculation)**: Ensures safe gaps between vehicles during lane changes.
- **fSLC (Single Lane Change Execution)**: Calculates lane change timings and ensures smooth transitions.

Real-time interaction functions:
```python
traci.vehicle.getPosition(vehicle_id)
traci.vehicle.setSpeed(vehicle_id, new_speed)
traci.vehicle.changeLane(vehicle_id, lane_index, duration)


```

## Outputs and Visualizations

### Terminal Output

The simulation logs lane change events in the terminal, including:

- **Vehicle IDs**: The IDs of vehicles performing lane changes.
- **Reasons for Lane Changes**: The reason behind each lane change, such as maintaining a safe distance.
- **Total Lane Change Scheduling Time**: The total time taken for the lane change scheduling process.

#### Sample Terminal Output:

```text
Vehicle v_1 started lane change from lane 0 to lane 1 at step 4 due to: Maintaining safe distance from leader.
Vehicle v_3 started lane change from lane 0 to lane 1 at step 9 due to: Maintaining safe distance from leader.
Vehicle v_4 started lane change from lane 0 to lane 1 at step 17 due to: Maintaining safe distance from leader.
Total lane change scheduling time: 456.65 ms

```



## Future Improvements

There are several potential enhancements for the lane change scheduling algorithm:

- **Extend the Algorithm for Multi-Lane Highways**: 
  Improve the algorithm to handle more complex road networks with multiple lanes, allowing for better lane change decisions in diverse traffic scenarios.

- **Integrate Machine Learning for Predictive Lane Change Decisions**: 
  Implement machine learning techniques to predict lane changes based on real-time traffic data, optimizing lane change decisions for better efficiency and safety.

- **Simulate Larger Road Networks and Traffic Conditions**: 
  Expand simulations to larger, more complex road networks with multi-lane highways, intersections, and varying traffic densities to evaluate the algorithm's scalability, adaptability, and performance in real-world traffic scenarios.
